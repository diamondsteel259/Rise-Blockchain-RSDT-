# RESISTANCE BLOCKCHAIN WHITEPAPER
## Privacy-First Cryptocurrency Fork of Monero

---

## ABSTRACT

Resistance Blockchain (RSDT) is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency fork of Monero v0.18.3.1, designed to combat censorship and promote financial privacy. Built on the principle "Censorship is control; privacy is resistance," RSDT implements enhanced privacy features, fee burning mechanisms, and a carefully structured premine allocation.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Mission Statement
In an era of increasing financial surveillance and censorship, Resistance Blockchain provides a decentralized, private, and censorship-resistant monetary system. Our mission is to create a cryptocurrency that prioritizes user privacy while maintaining transparency in governance and token distribution.

### 1.2 Core Principles
- **Privacy First**: Enhanced privacy through ZK-proofs and encrypted mempool
- **Censorship Resistance**: Decentralized network resistant to external control
- **Transparent Governance**: Clear premine allocation and vesting schedules
- **Sustainable Economics**: Fee burning and controlled inflation

## 3. TOKENOMICS

### 3.1 Supply Distribution
The 200M RSDT supply is distributed as follows:

#### Premine Allocation (17.25M RSDT - 8.625%)
1. **Liquidity Pool**: 4.5M RSDT (2.25%)
2. **Development Fund**: 3.75M RSDT (1.875%)
3. **Marketing Fund**: 3M RSDT (1.5%)
4. **Team Allocation**: 2.25M RSDT (1.125%)
5. **Treasury Fund**: 1.5M RSDT (0.75%)
6. **Founder Private**: 2.25M RSDT (1.125%)

#### Mining Supply (182.75M RSDT - 91.375%)
- Distributed through Proof-of-Work mining
- Initial reward: 50 RSDT per block
- Halving every 4 years
- Tail emission: 0.5 RSDT per block

### 3.2 Vesting Schedule

#### Immediate Release (25% of Premine)
- **4.3125M RSDT** available at launch
- Ensures liquidity and initial distribution

#### Locked Tokens (75% of Premine)
- **12.9375M RSDT** locked with various schedules
- Prevents market manipulation
- Ensures long-term commitment

#### Specific Vesting Schedules:
- **Liquidity**: 50% T1 listing, 50% @ $10M cap
- **Development**: 24-month linear vesting
- **Marketing**: 12-month linear vesting
- **Team**: Custom vesting schedule
- **Treasury**: DAO control after 6 months
- **Founder Private**: 50% launch, 25% @ 12mo, 25% @ halving

---

## 4. GOVERNANCE

### 4.1 Multi-Signature Control
- 6 founder wallets control premine releases
- 4/6 signatures required for vesting releases
- Prevents single-point-of-failure

### 4.2 DAO Transition
- Treasury fund transitions to DAO control after 6 months
- Community voting on development priorities
- Transparent fund allocation

---

## 5. PRIVACY PROTOCOL

### 5.1 Enhanced Privacy Features
- **ZK-Proofs**: Optional zero-knowledge proofs
- **Encrypted Mempool**: Peer-to-peer transaction encryption
- **Stealth Addresses**: One-time addresses for each transaction

### 5.2 Privacy Levels
- **Level 1**: Standard Monero privacy (ring signatures)
- **Level 2**: ZK-proofs enabled (optional)
- **Level 3**: Encrypted mempool (opportunistic)

---
